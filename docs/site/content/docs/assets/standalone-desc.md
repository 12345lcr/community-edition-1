A stand-alone cluster is a faster way to get a functioning cluster with minimal resources. A stand-alone cluster functions as a workload cluster, it can run application workloads. A stand-alone cluster does not contain any of the management components.  A stand-alone cluster is deployed using the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Installer.

When you create a stand-alone cluster, a bootstrap cluster is created on your local machine. This is a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)  based cluster - a cluster in a container.  This bootstrap cluster then creates a cluster on your specified provider, but it does not pivot into a management cluster - it functions as a workload cluster.  A workload cluster can be pivoted back to be a management cluster at a later point.
