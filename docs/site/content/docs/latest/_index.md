## Overview

Tanzu Community Edition (TCE) enables the creation of application platforms.
Application platforms are infrastructure, tooling, and services that foster
a viable location to run applications and enable positive developer experiences.

TCE does this by leveraging [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to
provide declarative deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes
acts as the foundation in which we orchestrate workloads. With this foundation
in place, TCE enables the installation of platform packages that support
applications running in clusters.

TCE allows you to get bootstrapped by providing a set of opinionated building blocks.
Additionally, it enables you to add or replace these with your own components. This
flexibility enables you to produce application platforms that meet your unique
requirements without having to start from scratch.
